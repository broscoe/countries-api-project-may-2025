## ✨ Features

### Home Page
The home page loads all of the countries from around the world listing their population, region, and capital. You can click on each card to get to the country details page
### Country Details Page
Each county has an expanded page where you can view the card in a larger format, see how many times that individual country card has been viewed, and click the heart button in order to add that country to the saved countries list

### Saved Countries page
The Saved Countries pages has a form that will submit user data to the database and a message that welcomes the most recent user. There is also an area that displays all of the cards from countries that have been saved to the database.

## 💭 Reflections

- This project was my first time building out a database, writing and testing API endpoints, and deploying a live server.
- This project incorporated a lot of new technologies and deployment techniques So it was exciting to build comfort and familiarity with those things.
- This project had one of the largest source trees that I have worked with, so at times it was hard to follow how data moved around the project
- In the future I would like to add more info to the country cards, add search functionality, and log in credentials.

## 🙌 Credits

I would like to thank my classmate Makeba for helping me trouble shoot, and my instructor Arianna for kindness, patience, and commitment to providing quality education.
